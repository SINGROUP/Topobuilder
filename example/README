This example shows how to build the topology file of a molecule with a 6-member ring, a 5-member ring, and a chain with a certain length.
Most of the force field parameters can be found in the par* file by searching ff of atoms specified previously in atom.ff. But there are
some missing, e.g. the bond connecting the 6-member ring and the 5-member ring (CG2R51-CG2R67). In this case we use CG2R67-CG2R67 instead,
assuming the parameters of CG2R67-CG2R67 whould be similar to that of CG2R51-CG2R67 bond. 

Further, angles will be built in the same way. If some information is missing, we enter it manually. The entered information of the missing
bonds will also be used when searching for force field parameters of angles, and that of the missing angles will be used when searching for 
force field parameters of dihedrals.

The missing information are already in the "input" file, so in this example you do not have to type them in by yourself when excuting the 
command.

Sorry that the pair and improper sections do not work correctly at present.
